                    Well, hello! My name is Alex Wilson. I’m an aspiring web developer and this is my portfolio.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A little about myself: I grew up in Austin and moved to New York City for college when I was 18. In 2008, I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Neural Science from NYU. At the time, I wasn’t ready for any further graduate studies, so I decided to go into the family business and I started cooking. I worked in restaurants in for the next several years, trying my hand in the front of house, back of house, management. When I was ready to leave NY, I made my way down to New Orleans for a year before coming back home to Austin. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once I was settled here, I realized I was ready for another chapter in my life. I began taking post-baccalaureate courses in physics and mathematics at the community college and then later at UT. As I worked my way through, I realized what a strong reliance these purely academic pursuits had on coding. Most of the job descriptions I stumbled upon called for a degree in physics, or computer science. So I started teaching myself the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to test the waters… And here we are! So excited to continue learning and building my body of work.
